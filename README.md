# Prophage
This will be the very first repo that contains the general scripts used to complete the project titled:
# Comprehensive survey of Curated Prophage Genomes for the Characterization of Prophage Composition and Insertion Behavior. 

This project has four aims:

1. To identify phage regions using the program PhiSpy (information at bottom of the page)
2. To use identified phage regions for the characterization of general phage genome characterization (e.g. gene length, count, codon usage distribution, species distribution/divergence, Integrase alignments. 
3. To use identified phage regions and their surrounding region to identify occurances of bacteriophage insertions into genes and tRNA sites. 
4. Lastly, we explore the concept of phage genome mosaicism and the general architecture of phage genomes. To do this, we identified the locations of hallmark phage genes relative to their distance from the Integrase gene.

Obviously this is not a completed work yet and many scripts still need to be fully streamlined. But for now I've tried to package the scripts as much as I can that addresses each aim.
